# Cube Insert OpenFlexure (Delta) Stage
This part adapts the OpenFlexure Delta-stage from Richard Bowman's group at the Bath University to the modular optical system UC2. It is basically a plate which has  4 ball-magnets on one side to adapt to 1 UC2 cubes and a flat surface equipped with 3 holes to adapt to the openflexure delta-stage.

Please have a look here for an updated version of the adapter: https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-OpenFlexureStage
